# jQuery SPA Dashboard Prototype

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) prototype built with jQuery, focused on demonstrating a simple authentication flow and dashboard layout without relying on modern frontend frameworks. It serves as an example of how to structure a modular, maintainable jQuery-based SPA with basic routing and views.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is an abstraction of a prototype originally developed in a professional context. It has been refactored to remove proprietary elements while preserving the core technical ideas for portfolio purposes.

## Features
- Project setup with modular structure
- Client-side routing with jQuery
- Basic authentication views:
  - Register
  - Login
- Placeholder Home view after login
- Reusable component structure (header, footer, etc.)
- Fully decoupled from original proprietary content

## Project Structure
- /assets         → Static files (CSS, JS, images)
- /components     → Shared UI components (header, footer, etc.)
- /pages          → Individual page views (login, register, home)
- /config         → App config files such as the Simple SPA z`
- /db         → Database config files (Firebase)
- /libs         → Utility functions
- /helpers         → Helper functions for business logic

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery
- Javascript (ES6)
- Firebase
- Other UI libraries

## Getting Started
1. Clone it:
<br>
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/jquery-spa-dashboard.git`

2. Run in dev mode or build it

## How It Works
This prototype uses hash-based routing to manage navigation between views without reloading the page.
